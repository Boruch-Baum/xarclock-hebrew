* xarclock with Hebrew support
https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/xarclock-hebrew

** Background
Medieval Jewish clocks seem to have run anti-clockwise. The only
surviving example of such that I'm aware is on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Town_Hall_(Prague)][Prague's Jewish town
hall]] [[https://www.google.com/search?q=prague+hebrew+clock+images][(2)]].

Sometime prior to April 1994, Jaime Garcia Ghirelli modified the
xclock program (Â©1989 X Consortium) to run anti-clockwise, because "If
clocks had been invented in Argentina (southern hemisphere), they
would run anti-clockwise. Down there a sundial runs the other way
around!". [[https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/X11/clocks/xarclock.tgz][That program (xarclock)]] is the basis for [[https://packages.debian.org/trixie/xarclock][debian's package
xarclock]]. However, it only has presentation options for Arabic or
Roman numeral face digits.

The version in this repository adds a -hebrew option.
